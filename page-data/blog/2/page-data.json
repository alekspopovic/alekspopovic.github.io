I lost the link to it, but according to an article I read, a big percentage of population likes to talk into their phones and home assistants. Maybe I am getting old, since it looked like the age group that uses it the most is 16-24? I think that's great (using the tech, not me getting old). Not only does it promote even more accessibility on the web, but it also gives us a glimpse into a future where we are no longer slaves to our clumsy fingers. I personally make too many typing mistakes, both on PC and smartphone keyboards.","tags":["web","react"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.6666666666666665,"src":"/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/bc8e0/voice.png","srcSet":"/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/8ac63/voice.png 200w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/3891b/voice.png 400w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/bc8e0/voice.png 800w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/6050d/voice.png 1200w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/00405/voice.png 1600w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/0e6e2/voice.png 1920w","srcWebp":"/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/ccdb5/voice.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/6b183/voice.webp 200w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/fc32b/voice.webp 400w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/ccdb5/voice.webp 800w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/9000d/voice.webp 1200w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/e0075/voice.webp 1600w,\n/static/a2244cabb7554fc37a4a2a8d6be10da4/30cf3/voice.webp 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Can you become more productive by making a productivity app?
