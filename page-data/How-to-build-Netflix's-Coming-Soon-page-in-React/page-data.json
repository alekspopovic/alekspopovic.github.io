I am going to show you how you can recreate Netflix’s Coming Soon page in React, and I will show you some interesting concepts that you can adapt and use in your other React projects, like handling and rendering data, using state hooks, and sharing states between your components. The whole project is a bit too lengthy to fit into a single blog post, but you can check out the video version with full instructions and explanations on Youtube:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEXc1UTTLzc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to build Netflix's Coming Soon page in React","series":null,"seriesLink":null,"date":"November 02, 2020","description":"A couple of days ago I noticed something interesting in the Netflix mobile app. It has a Coming Soon page which shows movies and TV shows that are soon coming to Netflix.
